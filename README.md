## Introduction

The project focuses on COVID-19 data analysis using real-world datasets.
It involves data preprocessing, exploration, and visualization to gain insights into the global impact of the pandemic. The analysis is conducted using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Folder containing the COVID-19 datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing the data analysis and visualization steps.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Data Sources

The COVID-19 data used in this analysis is obtained from various sources, including Worldometer, day-wise trends, 
group data, USA-specific data, and province-specific data.

## Data Exploration

1. Loaded the COVID-19 datasets using Pandas.
2. Explored the structure of the datasets, including columns and data types.
3. Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.

## Data Visualization

### Treemap Visualization

Utilized Plotly to create interactive treemap visualizations for the top 20 countries based on various COVID-19 statistics,
including total cases, total deaths, total recovered, and active cases. Each treemap visualizes the distribution of the statistic among different countries.

## Results

The project's analysis and visualizations offer insights into the impact of COVID-19 across countries and regions. 
The treemap visualizations provide an interactive way to explore how different statistics are distributed among the top 20 countries.

## Getting Started

To run this analysis on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Navigate to the `notebooks` folder and open the Jupyter notebooks to explore the analysis step by step.
